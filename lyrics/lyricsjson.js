"body": "\u201cThe Barefoot Boy with Boots On\u201d is one of many wild and woolly songs composed by the late Asa Martin of Irvine, Ky. Asa was, for much of his early career, a talent scout for several east Kentucky radio stations...back when live broadcasts were the rule rather than the exception. His inventive guitar style made him much in demand for recordings (he recorded extensively with Doc Roberts) and for fiddling contests. Probably Asa's most well known songs is \u201cHot Corn, Cold Corn,\u201d the very first surrealistic bluegrass song, recorded by Flatt and Scruggs. Asa died in his garden last August, ending a life of great vitality and music.<br><br>The tune I use here is not Asa's but rather \u201cThe Death of Floyd Collins,\u201d as inspired by Tracy Schwarz. The last verse is lifted from \u201cThe Dying Fishermsn's Lament\u201d or \u201cThe Raving of Sir Rupt.\u201d Take your pick.<br><br>Oh, the night was dark and cloudy<br>The moon was shining bright<br>The stars were casting burning rays<br>On the storm that raged that night<br>Lightening struck the cowshed<br>And the cows all chewed their cud<br>Moonlight set the prairie on fire<br>In the middle of the woods<br><br>Oh, the barefoot boy with boots on<br>Come a-shuffling down the street<br>His pants were full of pockets<br>And his boots were full of feet<br>He was born when he was a baby<br>His grandma's pride and joy<br>His only sister was a girl<br>And his brother was a boy<br><br>He never was a triplet<br>But he always was a twin<br>His legs were fastened to his knees<br>Just below his chin<br>And his feet were fastened to his ankles<br>Several inches from his shoulder<br>And when he grew up he became a man<br>And everyday got older<br><br>He married him a woman<br>Who quickly became his wife<br>For you see he could not marry her<br>And maintain a single life<br>Her head was full of notions<br>And her mouth was full of tongue<br>They raised a dozen children<br>All born when they was young<br><br>Six boys, five girls<br>And then another child<br>They never tried to raise them right<br>Just let them grow up wild<br>And late in the evening<br>They'd send them off to bed<br>Not sure if they was living<br>And they wished they all was dead<br><br>The youngest was a baby<br>But the oldest was one first<br>The good one was the bad one<br>But the bad one was the worst<br>They never knew their ages<br>No, they never seemed to care<br>\u2018Cause they knew they had a birthday<br>And it came \u2018round once a year<br><br>They never knew their father's age<br>But they always had a hunch<br>That he was born before their time<br>Was the oldest of the bunch<br>And when they died they could not speak<br>Their names they could not tell<br>The girls all went to heaven<br>And the boys all went to<br><br>The organ peeled potatoes<br>Lard was rendered by the choir<br>When the parson rang the dishrag<br>Someone set the church on fire<br>\u201cHole smokes!\u201d the preacher shouted<br>As he madly tour his hair<br>Now his head resembles heaven<br>For there'll be no parting there"

He and PeeWee Reese, a former wire splicer from western Kentucky, formed one of the great double play combos of the age. Robinson endured unimaginable taunting, threats, and dangers almost everywhere he played that year. Dodger owner, Branch Rickey, had obtained a promise from Robinson not to retaliate to such provocations. The Dodgers first series that season at Cincinnati's Crosley Field was met by a particularly antagonistic crowd. PeeWee, from just across the Ohio River, was a local favorite despite playing for the rival team. During the course of the game he'd simply had enough of the crowd's abuse of Robinson and called time. He walked over to Robinson, put is arm around Robinson's shoulder and casually talked to him.

She was born and raised in the Norton area, her father (the son of Irish immigrants) a foreman on the L&N railroad and her mother from a long line of singers native to the Wise County area. Her early years included playing in a string band with her brothers in 1914 and 1915 and from 1927-29 played with the Lonesome Pine Trailers, a popular local group that played intermittently on WOPI in Bristol and WEHC out of Emory and Henry College in Abingdon. Later years found Kate working in a WPA project organizing music programs and teaching guitar. From 1947 to 1954 Kate and Mrs. Meadie Moles broadcast on WNVA (Norton) as the Cumberland Valley Girls. The fifteen-minute program was aired twice weekly and included religious and sentimental songs, many of which Kate had written herself. Kate also teamed with \u201cWindy\u201d Wampler in the early fifties for a Sunday morning gospel program, also on WNVA.<br><br>Kate's songs, through her radio career, her frequent appearances and her generous sharing among friends and fellow musicians, are well known in many parts of southwest Virginia. Mountain Empire Community College in Big Stone Gap, Va. produced a limited edition album of Kate's music\u2014thanks to the efforts of George and Sherrod Reynolds and Roddy Moore. Since Kate's death in 1975, the album, along with a small songbook, are cherished remembrances of this strong, sensitive woman.</i><br><br>I found no rest for my soul<br>Till I heard that story told<br>Now I am in the shepherd's fold<br>And there's a deep settled peace in my soul<br><br>Chorus<br><br>There's a deep settled peace in my soul<br>I've been redeemed and made whole<br>I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb<br>And I know I understand<br>That deep settled peace in my soul<br><br>Let not your heart be troubled so<br>If to Jesus you will go<br>And in Him you'll learn to know<br>About the deep settled peace in your soul Chorus<br><br>And when death around you lies<br>And you must cross that great divide<br>If you have Jesus on your side<br>There'll be a deep settled peace in your soul Chorus"

Relative to Australia's population this was one of the largest demonstrations in world history. (It would be comparable to 5 million people demonstrating in the US.) Cathy Freeman, the Aboriginal Olympic champion, was one of the lead marchers.<br><br>Later, when Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic torch at the start of the 2000 Summer Games the symbolism of the two opposing, mutually existing elements of fire and water in the Opening Ceremony was not lost on those of us following the Reconciliation Movement. The day Freeman won the gold medal in the women's 400 meters a group of black and white Australian women were visiting my town. I was asked to join in welcoming them and composed this song in their honor. Kerrianne Cox was one of the women in that party and I asked her to join me on this recording.

But I was equally stunned by the \"leadership\" provided by the President and the Speaker of the House. They asked that we \"teach our children to resolve conflicts nonviolently\" and \"reject the culture of death\"...while overseeing the bombing of Yugoslavia.<br><br>We like our answers simple and clean in America. We're not a culture who easily summons the outrage to tackle difficult issues in complex and courageous ways. Call it the fault of Soundbite Politics, National Economic Numbness or Mass ADD...we're looking for single scapegoats: the parents, movies, violent video games, abortion, liberals...and that's only a small sampling of the newspaper commentaries I've read this week.<br><br>The truth, I believe, is a combination of many things. But this country is unique in really only one element of the puzzle. People in Europe and Canada, for instance, have equal access to the same movies, youth cults and video games we do. What they don't have is access to guns. In 1996 there were 16 handgun-related deaths in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada...and 9,390 in the United States. Half of the deaths were children. That's 13 everyday. A Littleton, Colorado every single day.<br><br>Hunter and sportsmen don't need handguns. Neither does anyone else. You are 43 times more likely to be harmed by a firearm is you have one in your home than if you don't. When was the last time you heard of a drive-by knifing? I'm sorry, this is a no-brainer. If my kid is a pyromaniac I make sure there is no fuel and no match anywhere. But getting rid of handguns is not the sole solution. It's far more complicated than that. Blame whatever disconnect you want, as long as we prove to our children via our national policies that violence is the answer...whether it is in the battlefield or in the death chamber...we're never going to teach them otherwise. Teenagers, especially, have radar homed in to adult hypocrisy. And they see it everyday.<br><br>To quote my friend, Coleman McCarthy, \"We teach mathematics as though the survival of the species depends on it, yet where are the studies of nonviolence and peace?\" Our kids come home able to quote from memory the dates and players in all of our major wars but rarely learn about Gandhi, King, Tolstoy, Dorothy Day. Unless and until we start educating our children and ourselves...in the home and, yes, in the schools...about other ways to deal with differences and conflict our future will look darkly like our past. And the \"back to basics\" curriculum will continue to be Readin', 'Ritin', 'Rithmatic, and Retribution.<br><br>"

Seldom have I been in such a positive, supportive and family-friendly gathering as was on the Mall in Washington that day. The call for \u201csensible laws and safe kids\u201d resonated throughout the country as gatherings took place in dozens of other cities seeking to include those that geography and economics prevented from attending the major march in DC. Despite what the \u201cthe nattering nabobs of negativity\u201d (to quote Spiro Agnew) portrayed, this was not a crowd of na\u00efve idealists. We were a crowd of very experienced idealists, tired of inaction, propaganda and constitutional misrepresentation aimed at putting the safety of our children and communities behind the paranoid fantasies of the few.

    "title": "West Virginia Mining Disaster\/Which Side Are You On?",
    "album":["Barefoot Boy with Boots On"],
"body": "John: banjo & vocal<br><br>Coal mining is the largest industry in the southwest Virginia area. Most of the songs popularized about coal mining deal with the many dangers inherent to working underground in the often unsafe conditions of the mines. But there's another danger involved\u2014that of staying above ground and waiting for the husbands, fathers, and lovers who risk their lives each day. Here are two songs written from a woman's perspective.<br><br>The first is a powerful reflection on the possibilities of that dread moment. Jean Ritchie, originally from the coal community of Viper, in Perry County, Ky., is one of my very favorite songwriters. Her more well known songs of the coal mining industry include \u201cBlack Waters\u201d and \u201cThe L & N Don't Stop Here Anymore.\u201d<br><br>When the National Miner's Union first started organizing in east Kentucky in the early part of this century, Florence and Sam Reece were two of the early organizers. Part of the idea behind the NMU was that the wives and children of the miners were part of the union as well as the men, for mining touched every member of the family. Florence wrote these new words to the tune \u201cLay the Lilies Low\u201d following a raid on the Reece home by the hired gun thugs of John Henry Blair, high sheriff of Harlan County, Ky. Additional words are from picket lines of the Brookside strike (subject of the film Harlan County, USA) and Sterns, Ky.<br><br>Say, did you see him walking<br>It was early this morning<br>He passed by your houses<br>On his way to the coal<br><br>He was tall, he was slender<br>And his young eyes so tender<br>His occupation was mining<br>West Virginia his home<br><br>It was just before twelve<br>I was feeding the children<br>Ben Mosley come running<br>For to bring us the news<br><br>\u201cNumber 8 is all flooded<br>\u201cMany men are in danger<br>\u201cAnd we don't know their number<br>\u201cBut we fear they're all doomed.\u201d<br><br>So I picked up the baby<br>And I left all the others<br>For to comfort each other<br>And to care for their own<br><br>There's Timmy fourteen<br>And there's John not much younger<br>Soon their own time will be coming<br>To go down the black hole<br><br>Oh, if I had the money<br>To do more than just feed them<br>I'd give them good learnin'<br>The best could be found<br><br>So that when they grew up<br>They'd be checkers and weighers<br>And not spend their life a-drillin'<br>In the dark underground<br><br>What will I tell to my<br>Three little babies?<br>And it's what will I tell<br>His dear mother at home?<br><br>And it's what will I tell<br>My heart that's sure dying?<br>My heart that's sure dying<br>Since my darling is gone?<br><br>***<br><br>Come all of you good workers<br>Good news to you I'll tell<br>Of how the good old union <br>Has come in here to dwell<br><br>Chorus<br><br>Which side are you on?<br>Which side are on?<br>Which side are you on?<br>Tell me, which side are on?<br><br>They say in Harlan County<br>There are no neutrals there <br>You'll be either a union man<br>Or a thug for JH Blair Chorus<br><br>My daddy was a miner<br>And I'm a miner's son<br>And I'll stick with the union<br>Until every battle's won Chorus<br><br>My daddy was a miner<br>And I'm a miner's daughter<br>And I'll stick with the union<br>Through hell and high water Chorus<br><br>We're fighting for a contract<br>We're fighting to be free<br>I'll see you at the picket line<br>There's room for you and me Chorus<br><br>If you don't want to lose your life<br>Down in the old coal mine<br>I'll see you in the morning<br>Down at the picket line Chorus<br><br>Don't scab for the bosses<br>Don't listen to their lies<br>Us poor folks haven't got a chance<br>Unless we organize Chorus<br>"

Being as we were about 8 1\/2 months pregnant over at our house I tried to beg off, but, on my wife, Parthy's insistence, we drove over the mountain for the concert that evening. Well, they had the sound cranked up just a little too high for the first number and Willie, sitting in the front row on the inside of his mother's lap, got the loudest shot of his father's fiddling he'd ever gotten. He immediately started to dance...and didn't stop for the next two hours. Si loved it.<br><br>A week or so after Willie's birth he got his first piece of mail. It was from Si: a wonderful little box.

Barbara’s essay so clearly resonated<br />with me that this song was an easy write.<br />I can see it so clear<br />That very first time<br />At a game with my Dad<br />I was eight, maybe nine<br />We all rose to our feet<br />Before the ballgame could start<br />We took off our caps<br />And put our hands to our hearts<br />First Chorus<br />It was more than a banner<br />It was more than a song<br />I sang because I believed<br />I sang because I belonged<br />I sang for all those who dreamed<br />For all those who dared<br />Who looked to the heights<br />And our flag was still there<br />I see it passing on cars<br />I see it passing for war<br />I see it passing for patriotism<br />I have seen it before<br />I’ve seen it used as a weapon<br />To brand some as wrong<br />No one has the right, I’ll stand up and fight<br />To say I belong<br /><br />Chorus<br />And our flag is still there<br />For the saints and the sinners<br />Yes, our flag is still there<br />For all the losers and winners<br />For those who still dream<br />For those who still there<br />For the scorned and forgotten<br />Our flag is still there<br />Lawrence &amp; Lexington<br />Concord &amp; Kent<br />Seattle &amp; Selma<br />We are born of dissent<br />And on this native ground<br />Blessed by immigrant blood<br />In that river of freedom<br />We’re all washed in the flood Chorus<br />Bridge<br />It’s still there<br />Though we might disagree<br />If you are brave<br />In the land of the free<br />We have weathered so much<br />We have traveled so far<br />We are woven together<br />We are spangled with stars<br />So as we take off our caps<br />And as we all rise<br />Put our hands to our hearts<br />As we lift up our eyes<br />We begin with one question<br />We ask, “Oh, say, can you see?”<br />Stand and be strong, believe and belong<br />Be brave and be free Chorus<br />©2005 John McCutcheon &amp; Barbara Kingslover/Appalsongs (ASCAP)"

Carmen’s The<br />Yellow Star tells the legend of King Christian X during that period. (Read the book for<br />more information on him!) In the book’s author’s note she made passing reference to<br />the Helsingor Sewing Circle, a group of Danes who used fishing boats to lead the<br />exodus.

He and Pee Wee Reese, a former wire splicer from western<br />Kentucky, formed one of the great double play combos of the age. Robinson<br />endured unimaginable taunting, threats, and dangers almost everywhere he<br />played that year. Dodger owner, Branch Rickey, had obtained a promise from<br />Robinson not to retaliate to such provocations. The Dodgers first series that<br />season at Cincinnati’s Crosley Field was met by a particularly antagonistic crowd.<br />Pee Wee, from just across the Ohio River, was a local favorite despite playing for<br />the rival team. During the course of the game he’d simply had enough of the<br />crowd’s abuse of Robinson and called time. He walked over to Robinson, put is<br />arm around Robinson’s shoulder and casually talked to him. The crowd sat in<br />stunned silence.

According to Pete Seeger, he<br />read about the Italian Hall disaster in Mother Bloor&#39;s autobiography<br />We Are Many, published in 1940. (Woody&#39;s own notes confirm that<br />he got the idea for the song &quot;from the life of Mother Bloor.&quot;)<br />Ella Reeve &quot;Mother&quot; Bloor was an eyewitness to the events at Italian<br />Hall on Christmas Eve, 1913. A labor organizer from the East Coast,<br />Bloor was in Calumet working on the miners&#39; behalf with the Ladies<br />Auxiliary of the Western Federation of Miners. She was greatly<br />assisted in this work by Annie Clemenc, also known as Big Annie of<br />Calumet — the &quot;lady&quot; in Woody&#39;s song who hollers &quot;&#39;there&#39;s no such a<br />thing! / Keep on with your party, there&#39;s no such a thing.&#39;&quot;<br />Woody&#39;s song echoes the language of Bloor&#39;s account in many<br />places.

Thurner has found similar accounts in<br />English and Finnish-language newspapers from the period.<br /><br />Musicians: John: vocal &amp; baritone guitar/Tommy Emmanuel:<br />guitar/Stuart Duncan: fiddle<br />Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen<br />To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country<br />I&#39;ll take you to a place called Italian Hall<br />Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball<br />I&#39;ll take you through a door, and up a high stairs<br />Singing and dancing is heard everywhere<br />I will let you shake hands with the people you see<br />And watch the kids dance round that big Christmas tree<br />You ask about work and you ask about pay<br />They&#39;ll tell you that they make less than a dollar a day<br />Working the copper claims, risking their lives<br />So it&#39;s fun to spend Christmas with children and wives<br />There&#39;s talking and laughing and songs in the air<br /><br />And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere<br />Before you know it, you&#39;re friends with us all<br />And you&#39;re dancing around and around in the hall<br />Well, a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights<br />To play the piano, so you gotta keep quiet<br />To hear all this fun you would not realize<br />That the copper-boss thug-men are milling outside<br />The copper-boss thugs stuck their heads in the door<br />One of them yelled and he screamed, &quot;There&#39;s a fire!&quot;<br />A lady, she hollered, &quot;There&#39;s no such a thing!<br />Keep on with your party, there&#39;s no such a thing&quot;<br />A few people rushed, and it was only a few<br />&quot;It&#39;s only the thugs and the scabs fooling you&quot;<br />A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down<br />But the thugs held the door and he could not get out<br />And then others followed, a hundred or more<br />But most everybody remained on the floor<br />The gun-thugs they laughed at their murderous joke<br />While the children were smothered on the stair by the door<br /><br />Such a terrible sight I never did see<br />We carried our children back up to their tree<br />The scabs outside still laughed at their spree<br />And the children that died there were seventy-three<br />The piano played a slow funeral tune<br />And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon<br />The parents they cried and the miners they moaned<br />&quot;See what your greed for money has done&quot;<br />© Copyright 1961 (renewed) by Woody Guthrie Publications, Inc."

The crash occurred in Los Gatos Canyon and not in the<br />town of Los Gatos itself, which is in Santa Clara County ,<br />approximately 150 miles away. The crash resulted in the deaths of<br />32 people, 4 Americans and 28 migrant farm workers who were being<br />deported from California back to Mexico .<br />The genesis of &quot;Deportee&quot; reportedly occurred when Guthrie was<br />struck by the fact that radio and newspaper coverage of the event did<br />not give the victims&#39; names, but instead referred to them merely as<br />&quot;deportees.&quot; For example, none of the deportees&#39; names were printed<br />in the January 29, 1948 New York Times report, only those of the<br />flight crew and the security guard.<br />Guthrie responded with a poem, which, when it was first written,<br />featured only rudimentary musical accompaniment, with Guthrie<br />chanting the song rather than singing it. A decade later, Guthrie&#39;s<br />poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a<br />schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman.<br />The Mexican victims of the accident were placed in a mass grave at<br />Holy Cross Cemetery in Fresno, California .<br />This is one of the last great songs Woody would write.<br />Musicians: John: vocal &amp; guitar/Brittany Haas: fiddle/Stuart Duncan:<br />fiddle &amp; bowed zither/Fats Kaplin: accordion/Bryn Davies: bass/Kathy<br />Mattea: vocal<br />The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting<br />The oranges piled up in their creosote dumps<br />You’re flying them back to the Mexican border<br />To pay all their money to wade back again<br /><br />Chorus:<br />Goodbye to my Juan, Goodbye, Rosalita<br />Adios, mis amigos, Jesus y Maria<br />You won’t have a name when you ride that big airplane<br />And all they will call you will be deportees<br />My father’s own father we waded that river<br />They took all the money he made in his life<br />My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees<br />And they rode in the trucks till they took down and died<br />Some of us are illegal and some are not wanted<br />Our work contract’s out and we have to move on<br />Six hundred miles to that Mexican borders<br />They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves<br />We died in your hills we died in your deserts<br />We died in your valleys we died on your plains<br />We died ‘neath your trees and we died in your bushes<br />Both sides of the river we died just the same<br />The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon<br />A fireball of lightening and shook all our hills<br />Who are these friends all scattered like dry leaves<br />The radio says they are just deportees<br />Is the best way we can grow our big orchards<br />Is the best way we can grow our good fruit<br />To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil<br />And be called by no name except deportees<br /><br />©1961 (renewed) by Woody Guthrie Publications, Inc. & TRO-Ludlow Music, Inc.

In the<br />late 1940’s Dias, known on the radio as “Joseito,” would open up the<br />papers and improvise the scandal of the day to the melody. At the same<br />time, a classical pianist and composer, Julian Orbon discovered that the<br />stanzas in Martí’s last book “Versos Sencillos” could be sung to the popular<br />melody and “Guantanamera” as we know it was born. Pete learned it from<br />kids at a summer camp that employed an ex-pat Cuban counselor, a<br />former student of Orbon’s.<br />I’m joined on this recording by my old friend Katia Cardenal, one half of my<br />favorite duo, Guardabaranco, late of Managua, Nicaragua.<br />John: vocals<br />Katia Cardenal: vocals<br />Jon: piano &amp; harmony vocals<br />JT: bass &amp; harmony vocals<br />Pete: electric guitar<br />Jos: congas<br />Todd Harrison: percussion<br />Kevin Davis: percussion<br />Graham Breedlove: trumpet<br />Luke Brimhall: trombone<br />Antonio Orta: saxophone<br />Guantanamera, guajira Guantanamera<br />Guantanamera, guajira Guantanamera<br />Yo soy un hombre sincero,<br />De donde crece la palma,<br />Yo soy un hombre sincero,<br /><br />De donde crece la palma,<br />Y antes de morirme quiero<br />Echar mis versos del alma<br />Chorus<br />Guantanamera, guajira Guantanamera<br />Guantanamera, guajira Guantanamera<br /><br />Mi verso es de un verde claro,<br />Y de un carmin encenidido,<br />Mi verso es de un verde claro,<br />Y de un carmin encenidido,<br />Mi verso es un cierro herido<br />Que busca en el monte amparo.

It was written to a traditional form, the “talking blues,”<br />with spoken words over a repeating guitar or banjo accompaniment. Basically,<br />archetypal white rap music. When Jim Musselman of Appleseed Records asked<br />me to record this song, I invited my friend Corey Harris to bring it into the 21 st<br />century.

In a letter to Sam<br />Murray dated March 22, 1915, Hill commented on its popularity.<br />Yes, that Tipperary song is spreading like the smallpox they say.<br />Sec. 69 [Secretary of Local 69] tells me that there is a steady<br />stream of silver from &#39;Frisco on account of it. The unemployed all<br />over the country have adopted it as a marching song in their<br />parades, and in New York City they changed it to some extent, so<br />as to fit the brand of soup dished out in N.

No<br />place could have been more unexpected than the epicenter of a<br />bombing attack. The piece he chose, Albinoni’s Adagio in G<br />minor, was the lone piece of music recovered from the National<br />Museum after the firebombing of Dresden. It was an adagio never<br />completed by the composer (it was amended later by an Albinoni<br />scholar).

He was 78 years old at the time and one<br />of the most remarkable people I’d ever met. Nim was born in Martin<br />County, KY and went to work in the coalmines of Mingo County, WV<br />at the age of 14. Worked there for the next 42 years. He worked<br />alongside Mother Jones and John L. Lewis to bring the United Mine<br />Workers of America into West Virginia, no mean feat! He fought in<br />the infamous Battle of Blair Mountain in 1921, which saw the first use<br />of air warfare against American citizens and, simultaneously,<br />introduced the term “red neck” to our culture, as the miners wore red<br />bandanas around their necks to identify themselves to one another.<br />Nimrod was a great friend, mentor, and frequent musical<br />partner, as we traveled together far and wide to concerts, rallies, and<br />festivals. He released two albums, Passing Through the Garden<br />(June Appal) and Mother Jones’ Will (Rounder). One of Mike<br />Seeger’s final projects was a compilation of his recordings of Nimrod,<br />I Want to Go Where Things Are Beautiful (Twos &amp; Fews/Drag<br />City). I saw Nimrod for the final time at his 99 th birthday party on<br />November 5, 1994. He died three weeks later. Si and I wrote this<br />song as a tribute to Nimrod.<br />This chair is where he used to sit<br />Though he never sat for long<br />He’d stand, his hands would sweep the air<br />And bid us come along<br />He’d take us down a tune-ward path<br />That none had ever heard<br />And would not stop till everyone<br />Had memorized each word<br />Come home, come home<br />Just when I thought<br />I was traveling on my own<br /><br />The prodigal son who once went off to roam<br />Come home, come home<br />Coal dust settled on the words<br />And echoed through the mine<br />The sins, the songs, the fists, the fear<br />That marked that angry time<br />The church house silent on the hill<br />A lonesome choir sings<br />The gathering at the riverside<br />The sound of angel’s wings<br />Come home, come home<br />Just when you thought<br />You were traveling on your own<br />The prodigal son who once went off to roam<br />Come home, come home<br />Bridge<br />And, one by one, they’d file in<br />The crews, the teams, the gangs<br />The roughnecks, chalk-eyes, drivers, and bums<br />From every song he sang<br />The deer stand fearless in the wood<br />There’s fire in the hole<br />I see a light on the mountain top tonight<br />There’s glory in my soul<br />This chair is where he used to sit<br />Tonight it is unburdened of its load<br />He’s gone to lead some other choir<br />Down that dark and lonesome road<br />Sometimes it takes a simple man<br />To make a hero’s choice<br />And in the space between the notes<br />I still can hear his voice<br />Come home, come home<br />Just when we thought<br />We were traveling on our own<br /><br />The prodigal son who once went off to roam<br />Come home, come home<br />Charlottesville, VA August 26, 1996<br /><br />©2010 John McCutcheon/Appalsongs (ASCAP)"

She was a fierce<br />believer in the power of music to inspire and transform people, employing<br />that belief in her work at Highlander and beyond. In 1947, a group of<br />African American women from Charleston, SC, striking tobacco workers,<br />brought a song they’d adapted from the hymn “I’ll Be Alright Someday,” and<br />the song “We Shall Overcome” was born.<br />I first stumbled upon the Highlander Center in 1972, at the invitation of Guy<br />Carawan, Zilphia’s successor (along with his wife, Candie) as Cultural<br />Directors. I returned to Highlander many times, inaugurating my<br />Songwriting Camps there in 2013. Zilphia’s piano played a central part in<br />our Camps. In 2020 the many alumni of those Camps raised the money to<br />restore and refurbish the piano. I oversaw its delivery back to Highlander<br />2020 and wrote this song for its installation.<br />For more about Zilphia, her amazing life and work, see Kim Ruehl’s<br />wonderful new biography, A Singing Army: Zilphia Horton and the<br />Highlander Folk School.<br /><br />Zilphia’s piano<br />Today we celebrate<br />Built in Cincinnati<br />Back in 1928<br />It had to wait a while<br />Until it found a home<br />But the journey it would finally take<br />It never could have known<br />Zilphia’s piano<br />Finally did arrive<br />In Monteagle, TN<br />In 1935<br />It found its voice was loud and true<br />‘Neath fingers sure and strong<br />The hymns and anthems shook hearts and hills<br /><br />As we all sang along<br />From the tobacco fields of Charleston<br />To the Cumberland Plateau<br />The women brought their songs &amp; stories<br />All those years ago<br />In 1947<br />The battle was begun<br />And Zilphia’s piano<br />First played “We Shall Overcome”<br />Bridge<br />She knew the courage locked inside<br />The role that music played<br />And a new world waiting to be born<br />If we are not afraid<br />Now ninety-two years later<br />Its voice renewed once more<br />We gather all around her<br />As we oft’ have done before<br />Still steadfast, we shall not be moved<br />Yes, we shall overcome<br />New voices and new songs will join<br />In all the years to come<br />September 8-9, 2020<br />New Market, TN &amp; Smoke Rise, GA<br /><br />©2020 John McCutcheon/Appalsongs (ASCAP)"
